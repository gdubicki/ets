.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
prefixes each line of a command's output with a timestamp. Lines are delimited
by CR, LF, or CRLF.
.Pp
The three forms in
.Sx SYNOPSIS
correspond to three command execution modes:
.Bl -bullet -width ""
.It
If given a single command without whitespace(s), or a command and its arguments,
execute the command with exec in a pty;
.It
If given a single command with whitespace(s), the command is treated as a shell
command and executed as
.Sq SHELL -c Ar shell_command Ns ,
where SHELL is the current user's login shell, or sh if login shell cannot be
determined;
.It
If given no command, output is read from stdin, and the user is responsible for
piping in a command's output.
.El
.Pp
There are three mutually exclusive timestamp modes:
.Bl -bullet -width ""
.It
The default is absolute time mode, where timestamps from the wall clock are
shown;
.It
.Fl s, -elapsed
turns on elapsed time mode, where every timestamp is the time elapsed from the
start of the command (using a monotonic clock);
.It
.Fl i, -incremental
turns on incremental time mode, where every timestamp is the time elapsed since
the last timestamp (using a monotonic clock).
.El
.Pp
The default format of the prefixed timestamps depends on the timestamp mode
active. Users may supply a custom format string with the
.Fl f, -format
option.
.Pp
The timezone for absolute timestamps can be controlled via the
.Fl u, -utc
and
.Fl z, -timezone
options. Local time is used by default.
.Pp
The full list of options:
.Bl -tag -width -indent
.It Fl s, -elapsed
Run in elapsed time mode.
.It Fl i, -incremental
Run in incremental time mode.
.It Fl f, -format Ar format
Use custom
.Xr strftime 3 Ns -style
format string
.Ar format
for prefixed timestamps.
.Pp
The default is
.Dq [%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S]
for absolute time mode and
.Dq [%H:%M:%S]
for elapsed and incremental time modes.
.Pp
See
.Sx FORMATTING DIRECTIVES
for details.
.It Fl u, -utc
Use UTC for absolute timestamps instead of local time.
.Pp
This option is mutually exclusive with
.Fl -z, -timezone Ns .
.It Fl z, -timezone Ar timezone
Use
.Ar timezone
for absolute timestamps instead of local time.
.Ar timezone
is an IANA time zone name, e.g.
.Dq America/Los_Angeles Ns .
.Pp
This option is mutually exclusive with
.Fl u, -utc Ns .
.It Fl c, -color
Print timestamps in color.
.It Fl d, -delimit
Change the delimiter between the timestamp and the command output.
.Pp
The default is space.
.El
.Sh FORMATTING DIRECTIVES
Formatting directives largely match
.Xr strftime 3 Ns 's directives
on FreeBSD and macOS, with the following differences:
.Bl -bullet -width ""
.It
Additional directives
.Sy %f
for microsecond and
.Sy %L
for millisecond are supported.
.It
POSIX locale extensions
.Sy %E*
and
.Sy %O*
are not supported;
.It
glibc extensions
.Sy %-*,
.Sy %_*,
and
.Sy %0*
are not supported;
.It
Directives
.Sy %G,
.Sy %g,
and
.Sy %+
are not supported.
